## üèÜ kaggle

### [CVPR 2022 Workshop: Image Matching: Local Features and Beyond](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/image-matching-challenge-2022)

- Fused the matching results from LoFTR, SuperGlue, DKM and QuadTreeAttention models
- Seted up ThreadPoolExecutor to deploy multi-threaded deduction of keypoints and computation of F-matrix
- Completed the four models in nine hours, and ultimately obtaining the **top 1%** of the results

### [Foursquare - Location Matching: Match point of interest data across datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/foursquare-location-matching) 

- Populate the BERT model with NaN text using the nearest (longitude and latitude) 5 points
- Generate POI candidates from the embeddings generated by the NLP model, and spatial nearest neighbours
- Create and train XGBoost binary classification models for each candidate rank to obtain the **IoU score : 0.942**

### [Sartorius - Cell Instance Segmentation: Detect single neuronal cells in microscopy images](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sartorius-cell-instance-segmentation) 

- Soluted by using ensemble learning of Detectron2 + Mask R-CNN
- Expanded the anchor selection as well as multi-scale images , used NMS to do Ensemble on the models
- Obtained the **Private LB = 0.340 (Top2%)**
